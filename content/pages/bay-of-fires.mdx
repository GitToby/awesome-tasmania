Renowned as Tasmania's premier conservation area and hailed by Lonely Planet as one of the world's 'Most Beautiful Beaches,' the Bay of Fires undeniably lives up to its stellar reputation. Along the northeast coast, this captivating conservation area unfolds with a series of magnificent bays adorned by bright orange lichen-clad granite boulders, creating a stunning contrast against the pristine sandy beaches and turquoise waters.

At the southern end, Binalong Bay, a tranquil beachside township, serves as the gateway to the Bay of Fires, while to the north, larapuna/Eddystone Point, within Mount William National Park, marks its boundary. Nestled within this coastal haven, Tasmanian beaches are celebrated for their beauty and seclusion, with the Bay of Fires standing out among the best. Ideal for unhurried strolls, swimming in the sheltered bays, rock fishing, and serene coastal camping tucked behind the dunes, it's a pocket of paradise that begs the question of how one could ever leave.

Embrace beach activities, indulge in bird-watching, and witness pods of dolphins gracefully cruising near the shore. The Bay of Fires is a haven for underwater enthusiasts, boasting scenic reefs, underwater caves, and abundant sea life. Whether packing for a leisurely camping escape or gearing up for snorkeling and diving adventures, this coastal gem promises an unforgettable Tasmanian experience.
