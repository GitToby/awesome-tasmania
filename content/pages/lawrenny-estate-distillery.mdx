Lawrenny Estate Distillery has been established as one of only a very few 'paddock to bottle' Estate single malt whiskies in the world. The barley grains are grown and harvested from the Lawrenny fields then mashed, fermented and distilled using the pure waters that flow through the Estate.

The story of Lawrenny commenced in the early as 1800’s, established by one of the most colourful characters in the history of Van Diemen’s Land, the colonial cattle tyoon , Lt. Edward Lord. At the time comprising of approximately 80,000 acres, Lawrenny Estate became renowned for farming premium cattle and sheep stocks as well as abundant fields of Wheat, Barley and Hops.

In 1991, the Mace Family took over the once majestic estate. Since purchasing Lawrenny, they have returned the property to its former glory of luscious gardens, fertile pastures and breading Black Angus beef cattle that are among the finest in the world.
