Hartz Mountains National Park stands as a testament to Tasmania's ancient geological history, shaped by glaciers and providing a captivating glimpse into the remote and rugged wilderness of the south-west. The park's towering mountain peaks offer an awe-inspiring vantage point, stretching endlessly towards the southern coast. As a haven for bushwalkers, Hartz Mountains is celebrated not only for its majestic mountains but also for its rich natural and cultural heritage, securing its esteemed position within Tasmania's Wilderness World Heritage Area.

Waterfalls cascade from the dolerite backbone, a silent witness to the deep layers of ice that once covered this landscape during the last Ice Age. This glacial legacy has bestowed the park with features like small glacial lakes and alpine cirques, creating a year-round dramatic spectacle. Winter transforms the landscape with snow and freezing temperatures, while spring unveils a vibrant tapestry of wildflowers, with the striking red blooms of the Tasmanian waratah illuminating the countryside.

Nestled at the southern end of the Huon Valley, Hartz Mountains National Park overlooks the breathtaking south-west mountain ranges and contributes to the prestigious Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area. Its high dolerite backbone, adorned with waterfalls and alpine lakes, hosts a variety of well-graded walking tracks. Destinations like Waratah Lookout, Arve Falls, and Lake Osborne offer gentle strolls, each under an hour return, providing a captivating glimpse into the awe-inspiring landscapes sculpted by ice over millions of years.
