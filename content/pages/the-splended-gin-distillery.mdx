In the heart of Tasmania, our commitment to innovation is epitomized in Splendid Gin. Our mission is clear: to craft gins of exceptional quality with delightful flavors that capture the essence of our picturesque home. Tasmania isn't just a location; it's the inspiration that flows into every bottle we produce.

The serendipitous meeting of two couples on the East Coast, residing in historical properties once graced by the renowned English writer, Louisa Ann Meredith, felt like more than mere coincidence. Imagining the bygone days in rose-filled gardens, where gin might have flowed as freely as the adjacent natural Spring water, the opportunity became unmistakable.

With the fragrance of plump mandarins, fresh from the tree, mingling with rosemary and coriander straight from the herb garden, a vision of something splendid began to take shape. The expertise of Nat Fryar, formerly the head winemaker of the famous Jansz sparkling, played a crucial role. Blending the purest Tasmanian spring water, a triple-distilled grape spirit, and undergoing a fourth distillation, Splendid Gin was born.

This uniquely Tasmanian gin pays homage to its English heritage, presenting an exceptional stand-alone sip for the connoisseur or a splendid mixer with tonic and citrus. A marriage of a romantic past with a contemporary twist, Splendid Gin is more than a drink; it's a journey into the heart of Tasmania's rich heritage, blended with modern decadence. Simply put, it's splendid.
