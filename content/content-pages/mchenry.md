McHenry Distillery is Australia’s southernmost whisky distillery and with its family heritage makes it the southernmost family-run distillery in the world.  Its location takes advantage of the cool-moist-maritime environment, giving the maturing spirit the right conditions to make the most of its time in the wooden barrels. The property also has its own abundant pure spring water which becomes the heart of the developing
spirit.

There’s nothing quite like the cool purity of air found in this part of the world. It wraps around the globe on the latitude 43°, leaving South America without crossing another land mass, until it eventually finds its way to the southern tip of Tasmania some 17,000km later. In that time the wave-whipped ocean has stripped out all but the distant memory of man’s influence.
