Wellington Park holds a special place in the hearts of both locals and visitors, standing as Tasmania's second most frequented attraction and the premier natural hotspot. This expansive 18,011-hectare reserve, governed by the Wellington Park Act 1993, offers a myriad of recreational opportunities, serves as a crucial communication hub, and provides Hobart with a vital source of drinking water. Though not designated as a National Park, its vast expanse stretches 30 kilometers westward from the 1270-meter summit of kunanyi/Mount Wellington, making it one of the state's largest preserved areas outside the Tasmanian World Heritage Area.

Accessible year-round via the sealed Pinnacle Road, the park provides stunning views from kunanyi/Mount Wellington. Managed by the City of Hobart, the road may close in winter due to snow and ice, and during hazardous fire conditions. Various access points, including Fern Tree, The Springs, and the Pinnacle, offer opportunities for walks and facilities, with parking available at these locations. Visitors should check road status, observe traffic signage, and consider shuttle buses for alternative transportation. Safety is paramount, and the park can be explored on foot through various walking tracks, such as the Pipeline Track, Hobart Rivulet Park, and New Town Rivulet Park. Additionally, the park is accessible from different points via a network of walking tracks and fire trails. Always check the weather and be prepared with the right gear for a safe and enjoyable visit.
