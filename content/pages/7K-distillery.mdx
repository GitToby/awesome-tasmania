At 7K Distillery, diversity is not just celebrated; it's the essence of who they are. A collective of individuals from different walks of life, drawn together by the magnetic pull of adventure inherent in small-batch experimental distilling.

Leading the charge is Tyler, the captain of this spirited endeavor. With a vision that transcends the ordinary, Tyler aims to continually push the boundaries of sustainability, unique flavors, and form. The goal? To curate experiences that are as distinct as they are unforgettable, experiences you won't find anywhere else.

The name 7K holds a Tasmanian secret - every postcode in the region starts with 7000. This symbolic connection to the land is more than just a geographical marker; it's a commitment. At 7K Distillery, sourcing ingredients from Tasmania is not just a choice; it's a testament to their belief in the care and craft that define everything made in this unique part of the world. It's a Tasmania thing.

Supporting local isn't just a business strategy; it's a reflection of the team's admiration for the independent, can-do spirit that defines Tasmanians. In every bottle crafted at 7K Distillery, you don't just taste spirits; you taste the essence of Tasmania - a place where passion meets craftsmanship, and each sip tells a story of adventure, commitment, and the unique spirit that is 7K.
