Rising majestically from Bass Strait, The Nut in Stanley is a captivating geological marvel that looms over the historic town in North-West Tasmania. Rooted in the remnants of a long-extinct volcano, this iconic Tasmanian landmark is safeguarded within The Nut State Reserve, forming an inseparable part of Stanley's vibrant life and scenic panorama. Commanding breathtaking views over the town, across Bass Strait, and towards Rocky Cape National Park, The Nut State Reserve stands as a picturesque haven, inviting visitors to indulge in scenic viewing, leisurely walks, picnics, and nature exploration.

Embark on a journey to the summit of The Nut via the walking track or opt for a more leisurely ascent aboard the chairlift, both promising panoramic vistas. At the summit, traverse the plateau on foot through the scenic circuit walk, reveling in the reserve's natural beauty. Beyond its aesthetic allure, The Nut State Reserve serves as a guardian for a nationally endangered straw daisy and offers vital breeding grounds for short-tailed shearwaters, peregrine falcons, Australian kestrels, and little penguins. It also holds sacred Tasmanian Aboriginal and historical sites, underscoring its deep significance to both present and past Aboriginal communities.

Originally named Circular Head by explorers George Bass and Matthew Flinders in 1798, The Nut's nomenclature has sparked speculation. Some attribute it to a concise form of its Aboriginal name, Moo-Nut-Re-Ker, while others link it to the massif's resilience during the construction of a breakwater, deeming it "a hard nut to crack." Regardless of its etymology, The Nut at 143 meters stands as an integral and enduring feature of Stanley's life and landscape, beckoning exploration via walking tracks or chairlift ascent.
